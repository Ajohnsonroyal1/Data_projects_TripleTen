# TripleTen_projects

Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.

Each project demonstrates skills in SQL, data visualization, spreadsheet modeling, and business-focused analytics. These case studies are based on real-world datasets and are designed to answer strategic business questions using data.

| Project Number | Title | Description |
| :------------: | :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Zuber SQL Data Analysis | Used SQL to analyze ride and weather data for a fictional ride-share company in Chicago. Tasks included aggregations, case logic, joins, and time-based filtering to understand how weather affects ride patterns. |
| 2 | Retail Returns Dashboard (Tableau) | Built an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing retail return behavior across categories, customer types, states, and time. Delivered visual storytelling with insights to reduce returns and improve operations. |
| 3 | NYC Airbnb Market Analysis | Analyzed real Airbnb data to identify high-performing neighborhoods and listing types. Used spreadsheets, pivot tables, and calculated fields to project annual revenue and recommend top investment opportunities. |
